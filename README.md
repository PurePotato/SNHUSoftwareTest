## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by completing extensive testing on it. This testing should include unit testing and coverage testing, as well as making sure that my tests are extensive past the requirements of the project. One thing that I am going to work on is increasing my code coverage for my programs. 

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by creating stories and requirements based on collaboration with the business user. These needs would require testing to ensure that the requirement was fulfilled to the users standard. Breaking user stories down into individual components will allow me to cover the requirements more thoroughly. 

## How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software in an Agile manner. I create individual user stories based on the requirements gven to me and try to anticipate any needs that may show. I also consult other developers to get opinions on the most efficient and secure way to complete a project. Throughout the development process, I create do testing on my programs, but had previously not used  testing software like JUnit to complete this. It was a manual process.
